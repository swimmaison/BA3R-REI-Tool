BA3R REI Tool:

Our team is setting out to build a tool for real estate investors and average homebuyers to get information and compare to the current market to make educated purchasing decisions for the user.

## User Story

```
AS AN potential homebuyer
I WANT an app that displays relevant information to purchasing a property
SO THAT I can make an educated decision on whether the property is a financially sound investment
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an input of a MLS number from the USER
WHEN I click the button to generate data
THEN I am presented with a card identifying the property I am interesting in finding more information for
WHEN I click to search for information of school
THEN I am presented with data of local school systems for ratings and population
WHEN I click the button to find similar comps to my home to validate market pricing
THEN I am presented with a series of similar homes that are available for the sale in the area with relevant data
WHEN I click the button to clear my results
THEN The page refreshes
WHEN I am using a mobile devise or browser
THEN The CSS dynamically reformats for a better UI.

```

## Future Build Out Potential

```
If we were to continue to build out this concept we would start by adding more functionality to support the USER in collecting data relevant to investment such as:

	- Similar properties sold within a distance radius
	- Similar spefications for rental listings

```
